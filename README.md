# Engine Management System

Arduino software for the EMS sensor board

Details are here: http://experimentalavionics.com/engine-management-system/

Unzip libraries.zip to the "libraries" folder in your Arduino environment.

Important notes:

Originally the EMS was built for 6 cylinder Jabiru engine but over time the direction changed towards 4 cylinder Jabiru and lately towards Rotax 912. The module should still support engines other than Rotax and the code still have parts that might need to be inspected and uncommented where required.
